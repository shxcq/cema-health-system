# Health Information System

A web application for doctors to manage health programs and clients, built with a Flask backend and React frontend.  
This project was developed as part of a Software Engineering Intern Task, focusing on clean code, usability, and extensibility.

The system allows doctors to create health programs (e.g., TB, Malaria, HIV), register clients, enroll clients in programs, search for clients, view client profiles, and expose client data via a RESTful API. It features a modern UI with React-Bootstrap, secure authentication with JWT, and a SQLite database for data persistence.

---

## Features

- **Create Health Programs**: Doctors can create programs with names and descriptions (e.g., TB, HIV) using `CreateProgram.tsx` and `SettingsPage.tsx`.
- **Register Clients**: Register new clients with details like first_name, last_name, email, and emergency_contact via `RegisterClient.tsx`.
- **Enroll/Unenroll Clients**: Enroll clients in programs using `EnrollClient.tsx` or manage enrollments in `ClientProfile.tsx`.
- **Search Clients**: Search for clients by name or email using `ClientListPage.tsx`, with case-insensitive search powered by `ilike`.
- **View Client Profiles**: View client details and enrolled programs in a two-column layout with `ClientProfile.tsx`.
- **Secure API**: RESTful API with JWT authentication, CORS restrictions, and input validation.
- **Responsive UI**: Modern design with React-Bootstrap and custom styles in `frontend/src/App.css`.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**: For the Flask backend.
- **Node.js 16+ and npm**: For the React frontend.
- **SQLite**: Used as the database (already included as `health_system.db`).
- **Git**: To clone the repository.

---

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shxcq/cema-health-system.git
cd health-information-system
```

### Set Up the Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: The backend uses `flask-cors` to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000` to fix CORS policy issues.

### Set Up the Frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

> **Note**: The frontend uses React-Bootstrap for UI components and Axios for API requests.

### Database Setup

The SQLite database (`health_system.db`) is already included in `backend/instance/`.  
If you need to reseed the database:

```bash
cd backend
python seed.py
```

> **Warning**: Reseeding will overwrite existing data. Ensure there are no duplicate `program.name` entries in `seed.py` to avoid UNIQUE constraint errors.

---

## Usage

### Run the Backend

From the `backend` directory, with the virtual environment activated:

```bash
python app.py
```

The Flask server will run on [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

> **Note**: The backend includes JWT authentication. The default credentials are:
> - **Username**: `doctor`
> - **Password**: `password`
>
> Ensure `user.id` in `create_access_token` is passed as a **string** to avoid JWT validation errors.

---

### Run the Frontend

From the `frontend` directory, in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run start
```

The React app will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

### Access the App

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
- Log in using the default credentials (`doctor/password`).
- You can:
  - Create programs in `SettingsPage.tsx` or `CreateProgram.tsx`
  - Register clients in `RegisterClient.tsx`
  - Enroll clients using `EnrollClient.tsx` or `ClientProfile.tsx`
  - Search clients in `ClientListPage.tsx`
  - View client profiles in `ClientProfile.tsx`

---

## API Endpoints

All API endpoints require JWT authentication.

### Clients

- `POST /api/clients`: Register a new client.
- `GET /api/clients`: List all clients.
- `PUT /api/clients/<id>`: Update a client.
- `GET /api/clients/<id>`: View a client's profile.
- `GET /api/clients/search`: Search clients by name or email.

### Programs

- `POST /api/programs`: Create a new program.
- `GET /api/programs`: List all programs.
- `PUT /api/programs/<id>`: Update a program.

### Enrollments

- `POST /api/clients/<id>/programs`: Enroll a client in a program.
- `DELETE /api/clients/<id>/programs`: Unenroll a client from a program.

### Authentication

- `POST /api/login`: Authenticate and receive a JWT token.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests in `backend/tests/` to validate API endpoints.
- Hash doctor passwords using a library like `bcrypt` (currently stored in plaintext).
- Deploy the application to Render or another cloud provider.
- Enhance the UI with more visual elements, such as charts in `Dashboard.tsx` to display client and program statistics.

- **Presentation**: `Health_Information_System_Presentation.pdf` (slides on approach, design, solution)
- **Report**: `Health_Information_System_Report.docx` (detailed explanations and code snippets)
